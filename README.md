# Welcome

_Do you have a ReprapGuru or other Prusa i3 clone?_

Here are notes I collected from my build of my "RepRapGuru V2 B" purchased from Amazon during the Fall of 2017.  I believe this is a pretty good kit but will require a little patience and time to understand what's going on, especially from someone rather new to the 3d printing field such as myself.

Should you listen me then?  There's a good question!  All I can say to that end is I've had a colorful and successful field in Computer Science for twenty years.  I am not a _hardware_ guy but I enjoy learning new things, have tackled extremely tough projects over the years, and enjoy hobbies such as _roasting coffee_ and my 3D printer happily sits on an very nice oak side table that I built in woodshop during my school years.  And I live in an older farmhouse which requires a certain amount of upkeep just to keep weatherproofed.  You know, stuff a family man might encounter who has too many kids in a quasi-rural area.

There were things that frustrated me and I quite imagine could baffle someone who is not a programmer or someone who is hobby-minded.  I hope these notes help you overcome similar problems.

A bit on organization:

- [Kit Review](Kit_Review): Would I recommend getting this kit:  A qualified _yes!_
- Build notes: these describe little notes I made to myself about the build, and some issues I had during the build that are worth noting.
- Initial calibration: after putting the thing together I needed to get a successful print. What to print first?  What settings and filament to use?   There is a lot of conflicting advice out there and I will hopefully cut through some of the noise with sensible settings.  The RRG build manual gets you through initial software setup but lacks information on this important step.
- Firmware: RRG firmware is based on the popular _Marlin_ firmware.  I have an updated branch and hope to commit my "RepRapGuru/V2" configuration upstream.  This isn't necessary but could be useful if you are going to tweak or machine later on.
- Filament: This is a growing list of filament choices I've made and notes I have on "dialing it in" for useful prints.  It is organizing by seller or manfacture and by type.  Here also are configuration notes for the filament for using the filament in a tool such as "slic3r".
- Software: So far I've used a small set of software: "Repetier-Host", "slic3r" and then some toying around on "tinkercad.com" and "thingiverse" for models.

## Build Notes

I did the foolish thing: I installed the LCD backwards!  Aye!  I tried to pay attention because this was clearly called out in the build manual but I didn't quite grasp the notion of "front" "back" and whether "right" was "stage right" or "audience right".  In terms of dumb user I think that was the worst of my mistakes and even that one is not fatal.  I simply need to print a part or two and whammo first modification.

This points to my first note on the build: the documentation is pretty good but it requires reading between the lines (or pictures) in some cases.  The manual often refers to older variations of the DYI kit which means some parts will not match or have changed in subtle ways: take your time.  Only a few tools are needed and this should be an enjoyable build.
