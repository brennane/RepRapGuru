# Welcome

_Do you have a ReprapGuru or other Prusa i3 clone?_

Here I have collected some notes on what worked, what didn't, and so on from my build of my "RepRapGuru V2 B" purchased from Amazon during the Fall of 2017.  I also have notes on calibration and issues that I've run into and overcome.  I also build a current version of "Marlin" firmware with the RepRapGuru (RRG) configuration changes.  RRG firmware is based on an older branch of the popular Marlin firmware and I wished to be able to tweak settings and move to the current stable firmware line.

## Build Notes

First let me say that I did the foolish thing: I installed the LCD backwards!  Aye!  I tried to pay attention because this was clearly called out in the build manual but I didn't quite grasp the notion of "front" "back" and whether "right" was "stage right" or "audience right".

I found some things worked well: in general I find this to be a good kit for a DIY type but may leave you wanting to improve, tweak and eventually build your next printer but before then I believe this can be dialed in for a quite enjoyable and servicable machine.

## Initial Calibration
