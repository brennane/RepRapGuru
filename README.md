## Do you have a ReprapGuru or other Prusa i3 clone?

Here I have collected some notes on what worked, what didn't, and so on from my build of my RepRapGuru V2 B purchased from Amazon during the Fall of 2017.  I also have notes on calibration and issues that I've run into and overcome.  I also build a current version of "Marlin" firmware with the RepRapGuru (RRG) configuration changes.  RRG firmware is based on an older branch of the popular Marlin firmware and I wished to be able to tweak settings and move to the current stable firmware line.
