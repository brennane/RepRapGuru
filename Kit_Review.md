# Kit quality

It is worth mentioning here my assessment of the kit, this is my own opinion and yours may differ.

## Overall: "B"

- Parts: mixed review, generally the parts are good generic clones.  But everything is a clone.  I did find some issues with my parts that needed revision.
- Completeness: This is a good functional printer, but lacks some of the nicer touches other kits have such as auto-leveling and a good quality filament spool.
- Documentation: Build manual is most of the time easy to follow, but it references older iterations of the hardware which makes things such as the "bill of materials" not quite match up with the current kit.  It also ends abruptly without providing advice on how to get to your first successful print after getting the software installed.
- Software: Open Source and Open Source software.  This is good since the DIY and reprap community is alive and well.
- Service: I have exchanged emails with the service team a few times and have a good feeling about their customer support.

## Completeness: "B+"

The kit has a heated glass bed.  I think a kit has to have at least that functionality to get into Prusa i3 range,
some kits you will find on Amazon will lack this.  The build plate is of a nice size, giving a 200mm square build service.
Again this good.  The kit is also very Open Source which means you have relatively tested and understood parts in the DIY
and 3d printer communities, that means there is probably a solution for you confusion and ideas on where to go next.

With this kit you should end up with solid foundation for printing PLA, PETG, and ABS.  Getting into more exotic materials
like wood or carbon reinforced plastics will require minor but accessible and affordable tweaks.  With a little effort,
and there will be some, this should be a satisfying project.   There are upgrades that this kit does not contain, perhaps
the most popular would be an auto-level sensor, easily enough to add.  The next would be an upgrade to an E3D hotend.

A failing in this kit is its mediocre solution for a filament spool holder.  Prepare yourself to print something up.  The provided pieces of acrylic are designed to hang on a wall mount of some sort.  But really these are not 

## Parts: "B" to "C+"

Grading criteria: a "C" would indicate measurable build quality issues or minimal kit (e.g. no heat bed).
"A" indicates a top-of-the line where we could use the "Prusa Kit" as a baseline.

### Less happy with

This hot end has me hot and bothered!  My biggest gripe is with the "extruder feeder" - the part that pulls the
filament to the hot end.  On my kit the spring was too light and as such the filament would not feed properly and my
results, esp. on inner fills, show missing lines and inpartial fills.  I still have a problem with the gear slipping
with my home-grown spring replacement.  RRG service is sending me a replacement part and I will update with that result.

The borosciliate glass was slightly too big for my build plate once the nuts were added.  I used a dremel and sand
small scoopes in the chamfered corner sections.  This did not take much work but was arguably more danger than I was
looking for as a small piece chipped away.

The linear bearings have as much "grind" as they have roll.  Thankfully the stepper motors are willing to ignore this and I have some lubrication around.  I'll think of them as sliders until I replace them some day.

The chord to the power supply uses the following color codes:  yellow, blue, red.  Even their build manual do not identify which is which.  I used a wall tester, alligator clips and a moment of danger to confirm which is which.  This chord is not US standard but an old European color code.  This typifies what I think RRG is doing fairly well: finding cheap parts that mostly work with few exceptions that they can cover with a good support team.

Kit lacked enough zip ties and didn't have any chord wrap as their pictured unit shows.  So you can't actually build that picture with the nice wrapped chords without purchasing other bits.  This is a minor nit compared to the other parts.

### Happier with

Electronics.  No issue with the arduino clone or its RAMPS 1.4 daugher board.  The stepper motor drivers were largely okay but I have two small complaints with those: first, they could use a little sanding to make them not overlap with each other; second, the potentiometer on those are really finicky (adjustable with a philips screwdriver) it took me a long time to get those tuned.

Frame is well enough, nothing fancy but put together well enough.  I do recommend the blue (removable) loctite for the large threaded supports if you don't want your printer to shake itself apart.
