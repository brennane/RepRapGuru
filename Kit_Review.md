# Kit quality

It is worth mentioning here my assessment of the kit, this is my own opinion and yours may differ.

## Overall: "B-"

Grading criteria: a "C" would indicate measurable build quality issues or minimal kit (e.g. no heat bed).
"A" indicates a top-of-the line where we could use the "Prusa Kit" as a baseline.

I give the Kit a "B minus" because I find a good amount of parts that typify a workable Prusa i3 DIY kit
that you might find elsewhere on Amazon.  Looking at the parts some are what I would expect and are decent
quality.  The stepper motors are decent, the arduino clone is servicable.  But I did find some fit issues with the
stepper motor controllers.  In general I find the parts typical of good quality generic parts.  You can find better parts
by certain brands as well as poor quality parts.  I get the feeling that the Rep Rap Guru folks sourced good cheap parts
for their kits that are both economical and generally well behaved.

There is a danger in this because we may have some issues with economic parts.

## Completeness: "B+"

The kit has a heated glass bed.  I think a kit has to have at least that functionality to get into Prusa i3 range,
some kits you will find on Amazon will lack this.  The build plate is of a nice size, giving a 200mm square build service.
Again this good.  The kit is also very Open Source which means you have relatively tested and understood parts in the DIY
and 3d printer communities, that means there is probably a solution for you confusion and ideas on where to go next.

With this kit you should end up with solid foundation for printing PLA, PETG, and ABS.  Getting into more exotic materials
like wood or carbon reinforced plastics will require minor but accessible and affordable tweaks.  With a little effort,
and there will be some, this should be a satisfying project.   There are upgrades that this kit does not contain, perhaps
the most popular would be an auto-level sensor, easily enough to add.  The next would be an upgrade to an E3D hotend.

A failing in this kit is its mediocre solution for a filament spool holder.  Prepare yourself to print something up.  The provided pieces of acrylic are designed to hang on a wall mount of some sort.  But really these are not 

## Parts: "B" to "C+"

This and other examples lead me to believe the kit is of a servicable quality but allows for upgrades as you grow.

I could argue for a "C plus" for the following two reasons:

1. This hot end has me hot and bothered!  My biggest gripe is with the "extruder feeder" - the part that pulls the
   filament to the hot end.  On my kit the spring was too light and as such the filament would not feed properly and my
   results, esp. on inner fills, show missing lines and inpartial fills.  I still have a problem with the gear slipping
   with my home-grown spring replacement.  RRG service is sending me a replacement part and I will update with that result.
2. The borosciliate glass was slightly too big for my build plate once the nuts were added.  I used a dremel and sand
   small scoopes in the chamfered corner sections.  This did not take much work but was arguably more danger than I was
   looking for as a small piece chipped away.
